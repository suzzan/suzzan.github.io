It's almost a month now , since I joined TechRise. And i can feel a difference in me. At first, I had no idea about coding except basics HTML and CSS. This basic understanding of coding is what made me to learn more. This thirst to learn is still inside of me. Altogether I am very glad that I found TechRise and got to be a part of it. It has changed the way I used to think about learning & doing things. 

The learning method at TechRise has completely surprised me. Because before I joined even i didn't think that a curriculum like this, and its learning way would actually work. It was completely different from everything I was doing my whole life. For example, in school , we attend school every day and learn the things teacher teaches and practise the same but the problem there is we don't listen to the teacher carefully and also we forget to do enough practises. So, in the end the outcome is null. At TechRise its completely opposite. We study new topics ourselves, do self learning, do  some research and find out what we can and finally review everything we have learned with a mentor, who is there 24/7, and also correct any mistakes as well as learn something new.The key feature is to self learn and its fun because no-one forces to do anything and because its interesting there is no room for boredom and giving up.

This new way of self learning sounds so easy until we try doing it ourselves, then it gives lots of pain. As the proverb says "No pain, No gain", believe me when I tell you, its totally worth it. I had also had lots of trouble and problems in each and every steps. Almost all the time I feel like "It works, I have no idea how, It doesn't works, I have no idea how!!". But even without understanding a lot at a time, slowl it all starts to make sense altogether.
 One of the most important thing that gives me the will to carry-on , and motivates me to go-on whenever I feel like giving up and nothing is making sense is the one only my greatest mentor at TechRise. Helping at each and every problems 
 and giving really great and simple examplesreally makes me hungry for more. And that's the way I learned at TechRise.
